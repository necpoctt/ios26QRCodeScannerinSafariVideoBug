  <h1>iOS 26 Video Bug – Opened via Built-in QR Code Scanner in Safari<</h1>
  <p>
    Steps to Reproduce:
    <ol>
      <li>On iOS 26 device, use the built-in Camera app to scan a QR code that points to:
        https://relaxed-brioche-3fd908.netlify.app/</li>
        (A minimal HTML page with a video element and MP4 source.)</li>
      <li>Tap the banner that appears after scanning to open the page.</li>
      <li>The video loads and plays normally on the first attempt.</li>
      <li>Close the page, then scan the same QR code again and open it.</li>
      <li>The video element shows the first frame but does not play.</li>
      <li>If Safari cache is cleared, it works again (until the issue repeats).</li>
    </ol>
